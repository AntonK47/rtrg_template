#### Real-Time Rendering Group: Application Template

This project provides a foundational setup for an SDL3-based application. It is intended as a starting point for developing graphics demos and prototypes. It is designed to streamline the initial configuration and serve as a scalable framework for future development.

A good starting point for a basic Vulkan application setup can be found in the "vulkan-first-triangle" branch.

Prerequisites:
 - CMake version 3.29 or higher
 - vcpkg package manager

Platforms:
 - Windows
 - Linux (not tested)

As the group evolves, this template will be expanded to incorporate additional features and capabilities, facilitating a smooth onboarding process for new members.

If you need specific features, tools, or libraries, please submit your proposals through the group's Discord channel.
